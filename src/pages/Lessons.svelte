        <p>Why study with me?</p>
        <p>I know you have lots of options.

<p>In over twenty years of orchestral playing, and almost 30 years of playing music, I have noticed for musicians to both not play to their potential and to not enjoy what they do.
  I want to help change that.</p>

<p>We will work on:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Deepening your connection with the music youâ€™re playing</li>
    <li>Finding a more sustainable way of playing your instrument</li>
    <li>Creating a more balanced approach to practicing and performing</li>
    <li>Learning to prevent injuries and feel better playing your instrument</li>
</ul>

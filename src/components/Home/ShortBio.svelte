      Hi, I’m Kip. That’s a viola. I have been playing music for almost 30 years, and teaching for over 15. But I like to think there's more to me. 
      <!-- A violist and an educator, Kip Riecken has performed with the Chicago and
      St. Louis Symphonies, the Civic Orchestra of Chicago, and alongside Yo-Yo Ma
      and Tabea Zimmerman. Kip's study of the Alexander Technique, an
      indispensable method for enhancing efficiency of movement and personal
      expression, inspires a lively and warm perspective on music-making and
      teaching. Click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOzQuf-qTzKJx6YfYTaJLpQ?view_as=subscriber">here</a> to see Kip talk about the Alexander Technique on
      YouTube. -->

  <h1>How to Lie Down</h1>
  <img src="/images/kangaroo.jpeg" class="w-50 m-5 shadow" alt="" />
  <p>
    I practice active rest just about every day, and have been doing so for
    about 10 years. I welcome you to try it.
  </p>
  <p>The basics:</p>
  <p>
    Find a quiet area where you won’t be disturbed. If the surface is not soft
    or carpeted, place a yoga mat or towel on the ground. Place a stack of books
    on the ground that support your neck.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tips for determining the height of books - if you stand with your back
    against a wall, chances are, unless you really strain your neck, the back of
    your head will not touch the wall. <strong
      >This is the straining you’re trying to prevent with the books.</strong
    > Books can be substituted with anything with a similar gentle firmness - a pillow
    or cushion, however, likely won’t provide the correct structure and thus may
    do more harm than good.
  </p>
  <p>
    Essentially, you’re looking for the amount of books that allow the front of
    your neck to stay free while the back of your neck also stays free.
  </p>
  <p>
    The opportunity this position provides, after all, is to that in which one
    might experience of not “using” the neck as actively as we might be used to
    in daily life - often a little too much. You may be thinking - no way, I
    know how to use my neck! Well, great! But just know that the benefits from
    improvement in this instance might be quite favorable.
  </p>
  <p>Think about it - that “pain in the neck”, or a neck-ache or whatever.</p>
  <p>
    Giving yourself a chance to release the neck is to practice a skill you may
    find coming in handy in many instances.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you have the correct number of books, place them in a pile on one of
    the ends of the mat. This is where you will rest your head.
  </p>
  <p>
    This position aims to help us release out of the habit of pulling our heads
    back and down. But don’t really worry about exactly what that means. It’s
    meant to allow us to release our neck, and possibly more.
  </p>
  <p>So just start there, and if you’d like, try some of these thoughts.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>I never have to move again</li>
    <li>I am what I am, and that’s fine</li>
    <li>My neck has to do nothing</li>
    <li>I am melting into the floor</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Practicing this lie down, and learning AT, can help in ways that you may not
    have expected. And it can all just start with this simple practice.

        Since an early age, I've been driven by curiosity, accountability, and
        service. Through music and academics, I had the opportunity to explore
        them. When I came across Alexander Technique, the approach seemed to
        offer a new definition of complete and healthy. It continues to inform
        everything I do and I welcome you to join my exploration.

            As a fellow at the Civic Orchestra of Chicago and New World
            Symphony, the desire to connect to a more well-rounded life through
            music inspired several initiatives, he designed and led several
            initiatives, from connecting with the farmworkers community in South
            Florida to securing Alexander Technique instruction for colleagues
            in Chicago. In <a

            In Miami, I designed and led Farm to Stage, a project solidifying
            the New World Symphony’s relationship with its community in Miami
            through a collaboration with the Farmworker Association of Florida
            in Homestead, Florida. This involved an interactive performance at
            the New World Symphony Center in Miami Beach, and FWAF headquarters
            in Homestead. The next year, I upped the ante to connect to South
            Florida even more by recruiting 16 other New World fellows to join
            for Damas y Caballeros, a project involving weekly Spanish lessons,
            and three community performances in which the fellows spoke in
            Spanish about the music.

              I maintain a lively discussion with the worldwide Alexander
              Technique community, from attending the 2015 International
              Congress for the AT in Limerick, Ireland on scholarship, to
              participating in the Alexander Technique Science Webinar, led by
              researchers Tim Cacciatore, Patrick Johnson and Rajal Cohen. I
              started a YouTube channel in May 2020 aimed at creating a new
              image of the technique and showing how it can be a part of
              everyone’s lives.
